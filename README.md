I am an upcoming CS researcher and prospective grad student. I have more than an year of undergraduate research experience.<br><br>

In 2022-23, I worked with [Dr. Rahul Suresh, *Siberian Federal University*](http://inspeq.sfu-kras.ru/Suresh) on the applications of ML in Physics. Our paper is under review and is to be published in [*Artificial Intelligence Review*](https://www.springer.com/journal/10462). 


<h3>I'm looking for research experience in Computer Science.</h3>
